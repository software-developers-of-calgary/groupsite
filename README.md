## Why join the SDC

- The SDC is for all levels of developers!
- Juniors come to add projects to their portfolio and grow their social network.
- Intermediates come to improve their code, developer their communication and leadership skills and of course grow their social network
- Seniors come because they enjoy coding, enjoy teaching, enjoy mentoring and most of all they like to give back what they received when they were Junior and Intermediate developers.
- No one person fits into the above tightly defined boxes, but this is a summary of the feedback we get from our members.
- Have fun coding, having fun meeting new friends and something new.
